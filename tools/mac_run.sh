# P0.11 — run a command on the Mac overflow host inside the arm64 Linux container.
#
# The Mac cannot run smb-opt natively (see tools/Dockerfile.smbopt), so every invocation
# goes through here. This is also the Mac's answer to the "never start a search without a
# cgroup cap" rule at the top of STATUS "Running jobs": macOS has no `systemd-run --scope
# -p MemoryMax=`, but a container gets a real cgroup, and --memory-swap equal to --memory
# forbids swap the way MemorySwapMax=0 does.
#
# usage: tools/mac_run.sh [-m MEM] -- <command> [args...]     (paths relative to repo root)
#   -m MEM   hard memory cap, docker syntax (default 6g)
#
# Keep -m below the Docker VM's own total (currently 7.65 GiB) — a cap above it does not fail
# cleanly, the VM OOM-kills the container. Raise the VM in Docker Desktop's GUI (Settings ->
# Resources -> Advanced), NOT via settings-store.json: see docs/experiments/P0.11-two-box.md.
#
# example:
#   tools/mac_run.sh -m 6g -- third_party/smb-opt/target/release/smb-opt bfscx W42Main ...
