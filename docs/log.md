# Session log (append-only; newest at the bottom)

## 2026-08-21 — Session 1: planning
**Did.** Researched the current state of the record (TASVideos publications, submission #8991S,
SMB1 Game Resources page, forum pp.59/62/63, user files, Wikipedia). Agreed target and
decisions with Matt (D1–D6). Wrote CLAUDE.md, PLAN.md, PROCESS.md, STATUS.md, docs/facts.md,
docs/hypotheses.md (H1–H20), docs/decisions.md, .gitignore, directory skeleton.

**Learned.** The warps record (#1715M, 17,868 frames) is from Jan 2011 and has survived
subpixel-perfect rewrites (2019) and two 2025 rewrites. Humans are 9 frames from the
RTA-rules TAS. ACE exists on NES only via cartridge swap; on FDS via the Minus World. No
public full-state exhaustive search exists (to verify in P0.8). Community bots were narrow.

Matt fixed the end-of-unit order: document → update STATUS → commit (last). Git initialized
and the scaffold committed. Then: pushed to a private GitHub repo; the Linux box becomes the
primary host (Matt will run sessions there); `docs/rom.md` added.

**Next.** P0.1 (tooling), P0.2 (fetch the .fm2, verify 17,868 frames + ROM hash), P0.5/P0.6
(disassembly models) can all proceed without the ROM. P0.3+ need the ROM in `roms/`.

## 2026-08-21 — Session 1 (cont.): P0.2 done on the Mac
**Did.** Matt supplied a dump (`Super Mario Bros. (World).nes`, NES 2.0 header). Downloaded the
#1715M movie (`data/wr/happylee-supermariobros,warped.fm2`), wrote `tools/verify_rom.py` and
`tools/fm2_info.py`. ROM data is byte-identical to TASVideos' (W) [!] (classic-header MD5/SHA1
match; movie romChecksum matches). Wrote a classic-header copy to `roms/` (gitignored).

**Learned.** Movie = 17,868 frames; last input is an A press on frame 17848 (0-based) followed
by 19 input-free frames (H1 baseline); Start first pressed on frame 41; L+R on 85 frames,
U+D never. The published length counts the trailing coast (F17).

**Next.** On the Linux box: copy the ROM into `roms/`, then P0.1 (tooling), P0.3 (sync the
WR and record the axe frame), P0.4 (RAM dump + slack table). P0.5/P0.6 need only the
disassembly.

## 2026-08-21 — Session 2 (Linux box): P0.1 tooling done
**Did.** First session on the Linux box (Fedora 43, i5-1335U, 15 GiB). ROM and WR movie were
already in place (ROM re-verified with `tools/verify_rom.py`). Host `sudo` needs a password, so
instead of blocking on Matt I built a rootless `toolbox` container (`smb1`) with FCEUX 2.6.6
(RPM Fusion, Lua 5.1), Xvfb, mono 6.12 (+libgdiplus) and dev tools; Mesen 2.1.1 runs natively;
BizHawk 2.11.1 runs on mono in the container. All three pass a headless Lua smoke test
(300 frames, RAM reads to a file). Wrote `tools/toolbox_setup.sh` (idempotent reproduce),
`tools/{fceux,mesen2,bizhawk}_run.sh`, `tools/lua/{smoke,bench}_*.lua`,
`docs/experiments/P0.1-tooling.md`; facts F18–F22.

**Learned.** Eight tooling gotchas (all in the experiment file): Mesen2 needs a pre-seeded
settings.json (else it opens the GUI wizard before checking `--testrunner`),
`DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=1` on Fedora 43, and file output (emu.log isn't on
stdout); FCEUX defaults to real-time speed and segfaults in `emu.exit()` after finishing;
BizHawk hangs on invisible modal dialogs (sound device, config version) until config.ini is
seeded; `toolbox run` drops the caller's env. Throughput: FCEUX ≈1,400 fps, Mesen2 ≈400 fps,
BizHawk ≈100 fps under Lua loops — reference emulators only. Boot-time frame alignment differs
by emulator (F22) — P0.3 must pin it down.

**Next.** P0.3: replay the WR .fm2 in FCEUX (`--playmov` + Lua), confirm the ending, record
the axe frame; then the same via BizHawk (fm2→bk2 conversion) as the second emulator.

## 2026-08-21 — Session 2 (cont.): P0.3 done — the WR syncs in FCEUX and BizHawk
**Did.** Replayed #1715M in FCEUX with a Lua per-frame dump (full 2 KiB RAM + 23 key addresses +
joypad byte) and in BizHawk/NesHawk (after writing `tools/fm2_to_bk2.py`, because BizHawk's
on-the-fly fm2 import pops an invisible dialog). Wrote `tools/check_sync.py` (alignment from
joypad bytes, transitions, lag rows) and `tools/compare_dumps.py` (cross-emulator diff).
Fetched doppelganger's disassembly to `data/disasm/smbdis.asm`.

**Learned.** Both emulators sync; their game state is identical frame-for-frame (F23). The axe is
touched on fm2 frame 17867 (0-based) — the movie's last frame (F24). 24 lag frames before the axe,
one per area/pipe load (F24). Index conventions: FCEUX row i ↔ fm2 frame i−1, BizHawk row i ↔ fm2
frame i (F25). Level-entry frames recorded (F26). BizHawk pauses at movie end by default
(`Movies.MovieEndAction`), which freezes Lua frame loops — fixed in config.

**Next.** P0.4: slack table from `data/wr/fceux_wr.ram` (framerule phase at each flagpole/axe,
frames lost to rounding per level, RNG at each entry). Then P0.5 (timing model from the
disassembly, checked against the dump).
